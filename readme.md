# Panorama Image Stitching Project

This project contains a Python script for stitching multiple overlapping images into a single panoramic image. It uses computer vision techniques to detect features, match them across images, estimate the necessary transformations for alignment, and blend them seamlessly.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. The code has been tested with Python 3.8 but should work with other versions with minor adjustments. Additionally, you'll need the following Python packages:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- imutils

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zahid7669/panorama.git


## Final Output

Below is the final output produced by the panorama stitching algorithm:
